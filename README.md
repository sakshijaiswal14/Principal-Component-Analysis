# Principal-Component-Analysis

It is difficult to visualize high dimensional data, we can use PCA to find the first two principal components, and visualize the data in this new, two-dimensional space, with a single scatter-plot. Before we do this though, we'll need to scale our data so that each feature has a single unit variance.
